Shall
I
compare
thee
to
a
summer's
day?
Thou
art
more
lovely
and
more
temperate.
Rough
winds
do
shake
the
darling
buds
of
May,
And
summer's
lease
hath
all
too
short
a
date.
Sometime
too
hot
the
eye
of
heaven
shines,
And
often
is
his
gold
complexion
dimm'd;
And
every
fair
from
fair
sometime
declines,
By
chance
or
nature's
changing
course
untrimm'd;
But
thy
eternal
summer
shall
not
fade
Nor
lose
possession
of
that
fair
thou
ow'st;
Nor
shall
Death
brag
thou
wander'st
in
his
shade,
When
in
eternal
lines
to
time
thou
grow'st:
So
long
as
men
can
breathe
or
eyes
can
see,
So
long
lives
this,
and
this
gives
life
to
thee.
